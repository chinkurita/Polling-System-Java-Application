# Polling-System-Java-Application
The Online Polling System is a Java application which has important features related to GUI and database properties that determine the software requirements for this project. This  project is meant for small scale voting processes like college elections or feedback forms. 
In  this project, we will provide an online tool to vote on various questions submitted by the administrator/organizer.

This application provides an easy and simple way to both administrator and voters in the collect polling process. In this application, voters can give their votes to the options that are already provided. The administrator can add all the details of the candidates with the selected department. The administrator can view all the details of the candidates and if necessary, he can delete the details of the candidate. All the details of the voters can be view in a combine form which makes the work of the administrator easy in analyzing the votes.

Prerequisite: MySQL connector for java must be downloaded in the same folders as the project.
